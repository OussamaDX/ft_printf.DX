 /// ////// MAKE my  own printf///
	//base 16 is hexadecimal numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 A B C D E F
	//base 10 is decimal numbers	 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  11 12 13 14 15


first tape :

	first we should make functions of printf string or character or adreese or hexadecimal ....

	look at this tableu in read it :

| Conversion | Short Description                                                                             |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| %c         | Print a single character.                                                                     |
| %s         | Print a string of characters.                                                                 |
| %p         | The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.                                        |
| %d         | Print a decimal (base 10) number.                                                             |
| %i         | Print an integer in base 10.                                                                  |
| %u         | Print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.                                                   |
| %x         | Print a number in hexadecimal (base 16), with lowercase.                                      |
| %X         | Print a number in hexadecimal (base 16), with uppercase.                                      |
| %%         | Print a percent sign.                                                                         |

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					we should know printf function is return length that printf
					sooo in this project we should work in len i puth second arguemnt in all
					functions who i write

	ft_putchar :

		first we creat putchar function that printf a character but we may add a second argument ,it is len
		this arg is len to how much the character who print

			 	-----------------void ft_puthar (char  c,int *len);----------------------------


	ft_putstr :

		second we creat putstr function to print string and again we add second argument yes its
		len arg is very important arg
		if you look in my function you see null case i write null not return because the oroginal
		function print "null" like that i whish you undrstand me okokoko
		next i write my function  is very simple

		---------------------------void	ft_putstr(const char *s, int *len)-------------------

	ft_putnbr :

			third we creat puutnbr funcions to print numbers and add len in the args this function is  very
			simple aand same time is smart because i use recursion you know that right :) you should know that			   ok i creat :
			------
			first condtion is special for number lower than 0 (negative number)
			i write ('-') char and i multilpy in -1 because convert number - to postive number cause we have -
			signe .
			-------
			second condtion is special for number lower than 10 (digits 0 - 9)
			this case is very simple because i dont use Calculation sooo i use ft_putchar to print this numbers			   and we addv '0' or 48 in ascii cause we search this numbers in ascii !!!
			-------
			third condition is for number upper than 10 i meen {15,100,99,30...}
			sooo first i devide this number at 10 because he give me number in the left and that return in the 			   second condtion i creat (digit number) ,

			----------------------------------------------------void	ft_putnbr_len(int n, int *len)------------------------------------------------------------
			next number again is % a 10 cause he give me number in the right and print it
			-------
			i wish you undestand that because is very simple dont wory and take eaassssy broo
	

second tape :

	we should again write prototype of own functions in a header in this example we have ft_printf.h
	my  opinion in this example we dont need to write a struct soooo we skip this tape


third tape :
	this tape is very importante we should creat a printf file and use stdarg and use it to creat own printf

		first function we creat in this file is (__check__flag__) this functio are search on own string for find % to know
		type of own argument (number or string or character , or adreese ....)
			in this functions finction we creat a va_list macro and we creat a string and a variabl int to know
			how much % we find
		wait this party is not end so we show you how his should work soo read this
			first : we creat a condition to find %
					char check_flag(char c,va_list args,int i);
					if (s[i+1] == '%')
					we write i + 1 because in this case i = 0;
					if s  = % so he entre in this condtion to find another conditions to find type of % s or d or c .... look  at tableau

			second : we creat another condition to find type of % and to know type own argument okk !
					if c == s so that s meens we have string so we use ft_putsr
					if c == c so that s meens we have character so we use ft_putchar
					if c == d so that s meens we have a number witn base 10 so we use ft_putnbr
					if c == i so that s meens we have a number witn base 10 so we use ft_//putnbr_base //(look at tableu)
					if c == p so that s meens we have a adreese so we should creat function to show adreesses
					if c == u  so we have creat a function print unsigned decimal number
					if c == x hexadecimal number with lowercase
					if c == X hexadecimal number with uppercase

			third : we puts our functions in condtion into their own function and put argument we need in own function
Fourth tape :
	this tape is very very importante cause we creat the original printf function okk!

		first : we creat my
		we creat all macoros we need va_list_arg_start_end ...
